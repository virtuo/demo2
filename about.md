Claire Garwacki is an acknowledged Swiss based headhunter, specialized in
Corporate Finance.
Her focus is the upper middle management level (controlling managers,
finance directors, senior controllers, senior accountants, heads of accounting).

Claire was previously Chief Financial Officer in the fashion industry and
a Senior Auditor for Ernst and Young Paris.
She joined the Recruiting Industry in 2011 when she realized - being a
client and a candidate - the importance of being listened to, and
understood by a peer. Claire started her recruiting career with a
renowned international firm and joined a few years later a well
 established Swiss boutique. Thanks to a rapidly growing word of mouth,
 her name has become a reference. Claire is now the owner of Froget
 Garwacki, Partner for finance recruitments.
