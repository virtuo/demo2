## Giving you access to my network

Over the last 11 years, I have developed a strong network of finance
professionals across Europe. They are my previous colleagues, managers,
providers or clients. Most of them are in a trustful relationship with their
employer, and therefore not necessarily aware of the possible opportunities
on the market


They are however always happy to catch-up with me and hear of external
career options.

I get to know most of my recent "candidates" via word of mouth and referrals.


## Strict selection

The screening I undertake consists of a 2 hour interview, covering all aspects
of the CV, as well as her/his financial and business skills. I also give a lot of
importance to the motivation : is this candidate going to be happy and stay in
your team ?

References are systematically taken, either early or later during the process.
